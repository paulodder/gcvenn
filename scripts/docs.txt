- write_expressions_tsv.py
Writes tsv files in format with x_value, and number of genes whose Jan expr lies within this range, and idem for GTE and TCGAN. Needed to plot the charts basically

- write_cumul_files.py
Writes tsv files that for each type of expression gives a range of
x_values with interval IV defined in top of file, for every x_value
it has a nofgenes attribute which specifies the number of genes with
that expression value or lower. This allows for rapid computation of
number of genes currently selected by taking the value of the brushes
XMAX and XMIN value and subtracting the number of genes whose
expression is less than XMIN from # of genes whose expression is less
than XMAX
